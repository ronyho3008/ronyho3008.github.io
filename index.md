# Hello Everyone 🌸

## and welcome to my channel
---
My name is Rony and unlike the picture I chose, I actually have curly hair

I'm originally from Haifa and now living in Jerusalem, just started studying here at the Weizmann Institute and currently on rotation in Prof. Michal Sharon's lab studing Proteasomes.

Outside the lab, I like to bake, do pilates, go on vecations and spend time with my friends.
